Step 1: Define the Problem
We need to maximize earnings based on:

Time required to develop each property:
Theatre: 5 units
Pub: 4 units
Commercial Park: 10 units
Earnings per time unit:
Theatre: $1500
Pub: $1000
Commercial Park: $3000
Constraints:
No parallel property development.
After n units of time, calculate the best mix of properties.
Step 2: Build the Approach
Key Observations:
Each property has a different "earning-per-time" ratio:

Theatre: 
1500
5
=
300
5
1500
​
 =300
Pub: 
1000
4
=
250

1000
​
 =250
Commercial Park: 
3000
10
=
300

3000
​
 =300
Hence, Theatres and Commercial Parks are equally efficient, while Pubs are slightly less efficient.

The problem can be treated as a knapsack problem, where:

Time is the capacity.
Each property is an "item" with a time cost and earning value.
Dynamic Programming Approach:
Let dp[t] be the maximum earnings that can be achieved in t units of time. Use the recurrence relation:


dp[t]=max(dp[t],dp[t−time(property)]+earning(property))
Initialize dp[0] = 0.
Iterate through all time units and all properties to calculate the maximum earnings.
Trace Back:
To determine the mix of properties:

Backtrack through the DP array to identify the combination of properties used.
